# BMI Calculator

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that I have created as my first project. The purpose of this application is to allow users to calculate their BMI by inputting their height in inches and weight in pounds. The application then outputs the BMI value, helping users to understand more about their body health metrics.

## Getting Started

To run this BMI Calculator on your local machine, simply clone the repository, and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites are needed for this project as it runs in any web browser supporting JavaScript.

### Running
To calculate your BMI:

Enter your height in inches in the "Your Height" input box.
Enter your weight in pounds in the "Your Weight" input box.
Click the "Compute BMI" button.
View your calculated BMI in the "Your BMI" output field.

### Built With

HTML - The markup language used to create the structure of the application.
CSS - Used to style the application.
